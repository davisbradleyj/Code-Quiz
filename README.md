# Code-Quiz


## Technologies Used
- HTML - used to create elements on the DOM
- CSS - present to add styling elements
- JavaScript - used to create the logic controlling the application
- Git - version control system to track changes to source code
- GitHub - hosts repository that can be deployed to GitHub Pages

## Summary

This one definitely kicked my read-end. I hit a wall with the getting the questions to render over my id tags, and really need to give a hat tip to Stephon Autrey for his time in helping me see some other options I had not conisdered, and to Kerwin Hy for providing some guidance in reworking some of the code to follow better JS logic which had been blocking the elements from working correctly.

Setting the majority of the pointer, global elements, and some of the more basic level functions and features did not pose as large an issue.  Getting and storing the high score was similarly not as big an obstacle.
